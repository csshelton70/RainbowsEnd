<center><h2>Rainbow's End Version History</h2></center>

<p>

The way I increment version numbers is:

<p>

<ul>
<li>Bug fixes and small adjustments get a .01 increment.</li>
<li>Changes that make a small difference in how the game is played get a .1 increment.</li>
<li>Changes that make a big difference in how the game is played, go to the next integer version number.</li>
</ul>
