# Rainbow's End

Rainbow's End is a Play by E-Mail (PBEM) game that was created in 2001 by Russell Wallace.  I do not own any rights to  this game or the soure code, I'm merely uploading it to github for others that might be interesting in a piece of gaming history.

I was lucky enough to play in a couple of the games that Russell ran when he was originally working on the code.  It was a fun game that everyone who played seemed to enjoy as well.
